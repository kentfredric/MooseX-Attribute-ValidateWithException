MooseX::Attribute::ValidateWithException

ALPHA QUALITY SOFTWARE.

At present, when an attribute fails validation, Moose internally die()'s
with a string. There is also no way to throw an exception object as part
of the validation message, ( in order to give more context on the
problem ), without also breaking how much of the validation works.

This module is an experiment in providing that feature, which really
should be done in Moose itself, and done better, which is why it has
been given such an obtuse name.

This module makes no promises of forwards compatibility with a future
Moose release, in order to permit Moose to do whatever they want and not
worry about "breaking code" that uses this module. ( So that they can
easily replace this module in incompatible ways )

If your code breaking is unacceptable, do *not* use this module.

Use of this module assumes several things.

1. You are o.k. with your code breaking in a future Moose release.
2. You are o.k. with re-writing any and all code that depends on this
functionality, if a future Moose release is incompatible with this
module.

I'm not saying I won't do my best to provide forwards compatibility, but
it is highly unlikely it will be possible, due to differences in package
naming which may be essential for handling exceptions.
